## var declaration

1. What is printed by line 9?
   
   Line 9 prints values added:  20
      
2. What is printed by line 13?
   
    Line 13 prints final result:  20

## let declaration
3. What is printed by line 9?
     
    values added: 20

4. What is printed by line 13?
   
      This will result in an error because the variable result is declared inside a loop and therefore only accessible inside that loop.

## const declaration

5. What is printed by line 9?
   
      This will result in an error because we try to modify the value of a const, which is not allowed.

6. What is printed by line 13?
   
      This will result in an error because not only did we try to modify the value of a const, but it is also not in scope since it is declared inside an if statement.
